# Stargate-JaffaHelmet

This is a cosplay project my friends and I have been working on, a replica Jaffa
uniform complete with animatronic helmet and staff weapon. Jaffa being from the
1994 movie "Stargate", or if you're more familiar, the TV series "SG1" that
came about some time later. But something that looks kinda like this...

Or if you're not a fan of silly doodles and questionable coloring skills, this
is a reference image we've been working from...

### Note

If you don't like my doodles, you're really not gonna like the rest of this
write-up because I do lots of them... you have been warned!

### Note

Rather than starting from scratch, we based things on an Instructables titled
[Animatronic Stargate Helmet](http://www.instructables.com/id/Animatronic-Stargate-helmet/)
by the user Honus. We've made many tweaks though; for instance opting to build
it out of EVA Foam instead of paper craft. Mechanically however, everything is
identical or works with Honus's tutorial. So for additional construction
questions, please check out that instructable.

### Note

I'll be detailing our modifications here. I'll try to keep it fairly generic as
the exact parts or form factors are less important than functionality. I
encourage people to take apart and reuse old things as much as possible as I
myself am learning how things are built and that's a great way to figure stuff
out!

## Breakdown

Below is a list of changes we've made so far, each links to the relevant
documentation...
