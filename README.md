# Stargate-JaffaHelmet

This is a cosplay project, a replica Jaffa uniform, complete with animatronic
helmet and staff weapon. Jaffa being from the 1994 movie "Stargate" and/or "SG1"
TV Series that followed. Something that looks kinda like this...

Or if you're not a fan of my silly doodles and questionable coloring skills,
this is a reference image we've been working from...

But if you really don't like my doodles, you're really not gonna like the rest
of this write-up because I do lots of them!

## Disclaimer

Rather than starting from scratch, we based things on an Instructables titled
[Animatronic Stargate Helmet](http://www.instructables.com/id/Animatronic-Stargate-helmet/)
by the user Honus. We've made many tweaks though, for instance opting to build
it out of EVA Foam instead of paper craft but mechanically everything is
identical. So for construction questions, please refer to the instructable, the
rest I'll document here.

Below is a list of changes we made, each is a link to relevant info...
